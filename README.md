# First Beat

First Beat is an iOS app designed for comedy improvisers and improv teams to practice full shows with real structure and timing.

The app generates a show suggestion, lets users choose a classic improv format (such as Montage or Harold), select a practice duration, and then guides the session with clear segment breakdowns and timers for both the full show and each segment.

First Beat is built to support focused, distraction-free rehearsal that mirrors real performance conditions.
